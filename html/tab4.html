    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
      For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.

              In the graph above you can see how much has been my
              electricity consumption during the following 5 months
              counted from December of last year until April of this year. 
              Thus, in the first month which was December, it can be seen 
              that there was a high consumption with respect to electricity, 
              but in the following month which was January, electricity 
              consumption increased by 1.3%, in the third month which 
              was February, there was a quite notorious decrease with 
              respect to electricity of 4.3%, in the month of March this 
              figure began to rise again by 3% and for the fifth month this 
              figure continued to rise by 1%.

          <p> </p>
            <b><li>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li></b>
            <p> $$ y=-7.40 \cdot 6 + 152.00 $$ $$ y=107.6 \text {Kwh} $$</p>
            <b><li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy.</li></b>
