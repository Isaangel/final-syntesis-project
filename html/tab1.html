<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  In this part you are going to work as a group to find information about the
  main concepts of this project
</p>

<h5/>
  Electric Energy
</h5>
  <p>
    It is the energy derived from electric potential energy or Kinetic energy
    the charged particles. This energy is generated by the movement of electrons
    from one to another. The joule or watt-second is the Fundamental unit of
    electrical energy.
  </p>
<h5/>
    Watt
    </h5>
    <p>
      A watt is a unit of power equal to one joule of work accomplished per
      second. It can be used to calculate the rate during wich energy is
      transported. The basic unit oF 1 watt is equivalent to 1 J/s.

  <h5/>
  Scatter Plot
</h5>
<p>It is a graph that show the relationship between to variables. It is an incredibly powerful type of graph, allowing viewers to
    inmmediately understand a relationship or trend that would be impossible to see in almost any other Form.
    <p/>
    <h5/>Linear regression</h5>
      <p> It is a basic and commonly used type oF predective analysis. This examine two things: (1) does a
        Set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome variable, (2) Wich variables in 
        particular are significant Predictors of outcome variable, and in what indicated by the magnitude 
        and. impact the outcome variable and sing of beta estimates - impact the outcome variable.</p>
        <h5/>Renewable Energie</h5>
        <p>Renewable energitesAre those energy, sources based on the use of the sun, wind, water or plant or animal biomass, among others. They are characterized by the fact that
          they do not use Fossil fuels - as is the case with conventional energies - but resources capable of unlimited renewal.</p>
