<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  In this part you are going to work as a group to find information about the
  main concepts of this project
</p>

  Electric Energy
</h5>
  <p>
    It is the energy derived from electric potential energy or Kinetic energy
    the charged particles. This energy is generated by the movement of electrons
    from one to another. The joule or watt-second is the Fundamental unit of
    electrical energy.

    Watt
    </h5>

  Scatter Plot
</h5>
<p>It is a graph that show the relationship between to variables. It is an incredibly powerful type of graph, allowing viewers to
    inmmediately understand a relationship or trend that would be impossible to see in almost any other Form.
